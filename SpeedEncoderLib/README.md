# Encoder Library

## Note

I do not believe that this will end up being in the main code.
It is mainly for the PID motor controller library to use and end main code will instead init the PID that will init this

As a result it is mostly internal for our group. This means the documentation is my lowest priority

This library extends the encoder library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder) to include ways to calculate the spede of the motor, which is the measurement we are most interested in.
