# ENGG3000_T6_Comms_B

## How to use / Installation

From the library manager (in the Arduino IDE either Ctrl+Shift+I or Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries) search for 'encoder' and install the one writtern by 'Paul Stoff Regen'

Copy each of the folders with Lib in there name into your Docuements/Arduino/libraries folder

then RESTART ARDUINO IDE it only scans this folder for new libraries on load

such that it looks like this
Docuements
->Arduino
  ->libraries
    ->PIDLib
      ->PIDLib.h
      ->PIDLib.ino
    ->SpeedEncoderLib
      ->SpeedEncoderLib.h
      ->SpeedEncoderLib.ino
    ->UltrasonicLib
    ->LaserGateLib
    
    
## Basic Use

A basic example for each of the libraries can be found in File->Examples (these examples will be near the bottom)
This is also a sanity check as if the examples don't apear here it means the libraries aren't installed properly
